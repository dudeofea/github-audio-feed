# About

This was made for the November 2016 Startup Edmonton Hackathon, really just as something to do while watching everyone else work on their projects. I figured I might as well save myself the effort of looking by simply listening

The tones & colours are generated based on the commit hash of the project and the time scale is sped up to make things interesting. Each project is assigned a table, in reality there were more projects than depicted but not all involved commits and I could only do one per table :(
